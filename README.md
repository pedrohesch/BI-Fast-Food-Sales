# BI-Fast-Food-Sales
This project represents the daily sales at a fast food store. Two calendar-based views and a dashboard with Power BI were developed.
The following files can be found here:

BI2017.pbix = Power BI file with the dashboard.
BI2017.png = Picture of the Dashboard.
Calendar2017.png = Calendar View using Calendar Plot. 2017 daily sales.
Calendar2014_2017.png =  Calendar View using Calendar Heat. 2014 to 2017 daily sales.

obs: there are few missing values on the system.
